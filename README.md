Free Energy Ideas

What we were doing in the Bavarian illuminati as we were taking a circular magnet and spinning it at a higher rate on top of an electromagnet and then taking liquid nitrogen in a fire extinguisher and blasting the spinning magnet to create a Quantum locking effect and freeze it in a spinning state. Then using it for free energy.
